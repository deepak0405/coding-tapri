Tapri is a tea stall sitauted mostly at the corner of the street, or outside an campus or office. We do have a lot of memories there, the memories of our long discussions about the office work, the discussions about the life and a lot more. The place is maninly as a hang out place where we discuss our day to day stuff. 


The same is the idea behind this blog Coding Tapri, its a place to discuss about the common coding practices and tech. So take a cup of tea and enjoy this blog
