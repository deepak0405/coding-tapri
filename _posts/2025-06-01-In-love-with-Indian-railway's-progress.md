I’ve always loved traveling by train. Some of my fondest childhood memories are of the journeys between Indore and Dewas.  It's a very happy feeling
to see the green fields, the sky and the old houses. The old British style railway stations reminds me of the Malgudi days TV series
with nice old homes with slanted roofs.

The new initiatives of Indian Railway are very impressive. The Vande Bharat trains are comfortable and provide good
views. The cleanliness and punctuality is commendable too.

It was super fun to see the Satpura Mountain ranges when travelling from Indore to Betul. To my surprise, the train
was fully booked and it was difficult to get a last minute reservation.

Our Railway is releasing new sleeper Vande Bharat trains and they also look impressive. The bullet train would be a big enhancement to our high speed railway network.

I really like the trains in Europe. They are spacious and beautifully designed. The trains in India lacks the cleanliness
and design aspects, but they are built considerably cheaper. The cost of ICE train is greater than 240 crores.

The equitable access to the luxury trains is a question though. The govt's official answer in this regard was that
they are already catering to the low income category and want to cater to the aspiring middle income category now.

I feel happy seeing the progress we're making! The future promises better railway stations, more punctual service, and high-speed trains ahead.
